The algorithm I used to verticalize webpage in this 
chrome extension comes from
https://github.com/cmonos/TAKETORI-JS

And the algorithm I used to remember last previewed position
cames from 
https://github.com/gilmoreorless/jquery-nearest
https://github.com/Arwid/jQuery.scrollIntoView


Here I hold the same kind of Licenses as all the libs/plugins I 
used in this program,
including those I did not mention,
which should still combines to be "The MIT License (MIT)" up to now.
